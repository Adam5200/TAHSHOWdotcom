                <h1>The Soundtrack</h1>
                <p>The Soundtrack is the most important element within the entire show. It itself was the inspiration to
                    create The Adam Hendrickson Show, and exists within the story to some degree. Naturally, there must
                    be a page on this website dedicated to this music. Here, I've included 13 tracks from the show, and
                    they're good ones too! If it were up to me I would post every single one but that's well over 100
                    tracks. Maybe someday! There are currently 3 TAHS Soundtrack album volumes out on Apple Music,
                    Spotify and other streaming services.

                            <p>This was the first piece of music I ever wrote for the show, all the way back in 2014.
                                The main melody at least, and the main idea of the whole thing. I love those bouncing
                                piano chords, they almost shuffle in a way. I always knew that the honky tonk piano
                                would be a very important instrument within the show, and this is the first time we hear
                                it. The main theme exists like this for the first 5 episodes, at which point Adam begins 
                                creating The Whitelake Soundtrack, and the theme is different in every episode from that point.</p>

                            <p>After I had conceptualized the idea of The Storyteller (though I did not know his name
                                yet), i still knew it had to sing a song in the beginning of the show. I struggled with
                                the idea for a long time, but eventually I thought the name of the song should be "Come
                                In". So I turned that into a melody (the first four notes of the song). Everything else
                                came pretty much naturally after that. Another thing I knew is that this song would
                                feature an accordion, which you can hear in the third verse "and now you're here at
                                whitelake...". Of course, this song features Elliot Jean, the voice actor for The
                                Storyteller. This was the first thing he ever recorded for the show, and as soon as I
                                heard it, I knew I had found the perfect voice. </p>

                            <p>The theme song is definitely the first thing I created for real, like musically. But this
                                is the first track I ever conceptualized. I knew that in the first episode of The Adam
                                Hendrickson Show, there would be a tour given at the end of Episode 1. I also knew the
                                tour guide would end up being the soundbooth technician, who eventually introduces Adam
                                to the chamber choir. The structure of the tour hasn't changed much since I first
                                envisioned it. This particular "version" of "The Tour Track" was written in 2019. Prior
                                to this, the "in-place" track was more or less the main theme with variation, similiar
                                in structure. That piece of music was later re-made and used (not on this web page) as
                                "Adam's Life Story" in Episode 2.</p>

                            </button>

                            <p>This track starts out actually with a softened reprise of a track heard, when Adam and
                                Arjun meet up. We hear it again here, perhaps because Arjun and Adam are in this
                                particular scene. I think though, this time we hear it, it has a proper ending, as it
                                gets cut off in episode 1. At this point, visually, Adam goes into his keyboarding
                                class. For this, I recorded a sort of "shy" version of the whitelake theme, and
                                improvised on it until I could bring it to "Come In", for when The Storyteller appears.
                                I love the echo on the synths during that quiet bit in the middle. I've had one viewer
                                tell me that this is their favorite track.</p>

                            <p>This track takes place during the first dream sequence, in Episode 4. Here, Adam runs
                                into the mysterious character Foster, who he has seen hanging around the girl of his
                                interest, Victoria. Foster begins telling Adam something, telling him to change his
                                path, but the dialogue is stilted, and dreamlike, Adam can't really make it out. The
                                Storyteller appears, and essentially tells Foster to back off. Foster responds by
                                explaining he has never seen The Storyteller before. Foster attempts to make Adam aware
                                of The Storyteller, but as Adam turns around to look, he wakes up. A fun fact about this
                                track. After the intro section, the next part that is faster, the chords I used for that
                                sequence, are not the chords from Come In, but the keys, like from the key changes in
                                Come In. F minor, F# minor, and G minor, in that order.</p>

                            <p>This is another theme I wrote when I was actually in high school, and it always had the
                                same function. To represent my wacky choir teacher. There really isn't much to say,
                                since it is such a simple melody. Before The Show, I had a version of this track that
                                was very similiar, though a little shorter, and much less professional sounding. I knew
                                WHERE the track was gonna be in the show, so when I wrote the dialogue for that scene, I
                                figured what I had written already would "line up". I was pretty much right, I only had
                                to add in a measure or two to capture the scene correctly.</p>

                                <p>This is one of the slowest tracks, and definitely one of the most boring I've written
                                    for the show. Why would I put it here if it's boring you might wonder? Well, because
                                    I still think it's great. I love how basic it is. It gives you a chance to single
                                    out particular instruments, and hear them in near full quality. At the end of the
                                    day, this track doesn't exist for some superb reason. It was made to be music behind
                                    The Storyteller giving his little speech near the end of this episode. But it is
                                    still appreciated nonetheless!</p>

                                <p>There is a particular chord-based theme that I've always thought to be "the romance
                                    theme". You can hear it getting used in all sorts of ways in this track, where Adam
                                    and Victoria are out on their first date at The Nice Cream House. This moment in the
                                    show marks a new point in Adam's life, as his heart begins to activate essentially,
                                    and it is reflected here in the music. It sounds almost disconnected from the rest
                                    of the show's music, but eventually, it always finds it's way back there. Perhaps
                                    the love he feels for Victoria begins to affect his composition skills, for the
                                    better. The end of this track also includes the score for part of the scene
                                    afterwards, when Adam is reciting these events to Amber in the soundbooth. The music
                                    gets a bit more "Come In"-y as we get closer to the soundbooth. However, their
                                    conversation soon turns to the subject of Foster, and his mysterious journal...</p>

                                <p>Following the previous track listed, Adam and Amber discuss Foster, before Amber gets
                                    called to the stage, leaving Adam alone in the booth. When this track begins, that
                                    is when Foster enters. This isn't the first time the two have met. Foster begins
                                    asking questions, and insinuiating that he is aware of some great knowledge, and
                                    that it is contained also in his journal.</p>

                                <p>This, again is more of an incidental piece. It begins with the chords of the main
                                    theme, in a weird key, so you don't hear it at first. The track soon transforms to a
                                    "Come In" reprise. This scene is when Adam is trying to figure out what to get
                                    Victoria for their one month anniversary. The Storyteller appears, and as he speaks
                                    to us, Adam gets new ideas. As we switch between Adam and The Storyteller, the motif
                                    changes. For The Storyteller, it is always "Come In", but for Adam, there is a mix
                                    of the main theme, and the whitelake theme. At the end of the track, we hear the
                                    main theme again, much more regally, with the original key and piano sound, marching
                                    along. Adam found the perfect gift idea.</p>

                                <p>For this unique part of the show, THIS track I feel best represents the style of
                                    music I decided on for this episode. There is lots of atmospheric elements, but we
                                    can hear the all-familiar TAHS sounds sprinkled in here and there, just to remind
                                    you that even though this episode is totally strange and seemingly unrelated.. it is
                                    still truly The Adam Hendrickson Show. The ending of this track is one of my
                                    favorite part of this whole soundtrack, with that bouncing piano. That theme
                                    originates way back in like 2015, when I wanted to come up with a theme for "The
                                    Gang". </p>

                                </button>

                                <p>This is where the show really starts to take shape. Once The Storyteller does what he
                                    does in this scene, we know that things will never ever be the same for Adam or
                                    Victoria. The theme we start out with in this track is actually going to be properly
                                    introduced in a future episode, so I won't talk about it here. But that finds it's
                                    way to the main theme... which finds it's way to "Come In", and THAT's where the
                                    song kicks off. After that, there are no rules. There is no description other than
                                    the audio file itself.</p>

                                <p>For this song, you have to keep in mind what this show means. You have to keep in
                                    mind the implication that "The Adam Hendrickson Show" is really just the end result
                                    of the events of the show. Something about that moment, when Adam is standing up on
                                    stage with the rest of the choir for the first time, looking out into the Whitelake
                                    auditorium. I'd say something about being there, and looking out into those seats
                                    and remembering sitting down in them on day one, with no idea that any of this would
                                    happen to him. And he feels so happy about it because it gives him all this energy
                                    to create music, and so he does.</p>
